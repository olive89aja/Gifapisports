# Gifapisports
We used the Giphy Api to generate images for each sport
Ten sports can be selected and users can add the sport of their choice on top. 
jQuery and Javascript are the main tools used to build this page. 
An Ajax call is made to extract data from the Giphy servers. 
It's possible to play/pause gifs for users thanks to some Javascript code.
